# Lyrify

Lyrify is a decentralized application (DApp) that allows users to post text, such as song lyrics, to the Ethereum blockchain. This enables users to permanently store a record of their written work in the blockchain, which may be used to protect content creators against copyright infringement.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development purposes.

### Installing

Follow these instructions to get a development environment up and running:

Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/sayak119/Lyrify.git
```

Install dependencies

```
cd Lyrify
npm i
```

Install testrpc

```
npm install -g ethereumjs-testrpc
```

Run testrpc in a terminal window

```
testrpc
```

Open a new terminal window and install truffle

```
npm install -g truffle
```

To compile and migrate the Solidity contracts, run the following commands in another terminal window:

```bash
truffle compile
truffle migrate --reset
```

Run the dev script

```
npm run dev
```

## Setting up MetaMask

1. On the MetaMask login page, click the "Restore from seed phrase" link.
2. Copy and paste the 12-word mnemonic from the testrpc output into the Wallet Seed textbox.
3. Change the network to "Localhost 8545".
4. As a check, note whether the Account 1 public key matches the first account in the testrpc output.
5. When clicking the Submit button on the home page, a MetaMask popup will ask you to confirm the transactions. You may need to transfer ETH from Account 1 to the sending account (if different) for the transaction to go through. Congrats! This transactions will be mined into the Ethereum blockchain!
